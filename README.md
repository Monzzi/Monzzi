- 👋 Hi there! I’m Monzzi, a passionate aspiring frontend web developer from the beautiful North of Spain.
- 🌱 I’m diving into the exciting world of web development, building skills from the ground up in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Express, Data Base and more.
- 🎯 My goal? To create meaningful and user-friendly digital experiences while continuously growing as a developer.
- 💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on projects where I can contribute my perspective, dedication and experience.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once lived in Italy, where my name (Montserrat) was a tongue twister for many! A friend started calling me Monzzi, and it stuck. Now it's my online identity.

Let’s connect and build something amazing together! 🚀
