- 👋 Hi, I’m @Monzzi from North of Spain. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning web and app development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS and much more, all from 0.

- 😄 Pronouns: She.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to live in Italy and nobody could pronounce my name (Montserrat), so a dear friend started calling me Monzzi. Since then, online I'm Monzzi. Good Luck Everyone!!
